    <h1>Grind At The Correct Coarseness (Or Fineness) Setting</h1>
    <p>Different brewing methods require different grind sizes to make great coffee. But how do you know if youâ€™re using the right size? There are two really easy ways to tell: time, and taste. With our pour over recipes, we aim for the coffee to be brewed in about three and a half minutes. If the coffee brews too quickly, it means the grind was too coarse. If it brews too slowly, it means the grind was too fine. Additionally, if a coffee that tastes too acidic and sour it usually means the grind was too coarse, and if it tastes too bitter, it means the grind was too fine.

        Generally speaking, espresso requires a fine grind, pour-overs and AeroPress require a medium grind, and French Presses require a coarse grind. Adjusting your grind setting to time and taste will bring you one step closer to delicious coffee at home.
