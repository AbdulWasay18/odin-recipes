    <h1>Use A Burr Grinder</h1>
    <p>A great grinder is one of the most important tools in brewing coffee. The particle size of ground coffee determines how quickly flavors are extracted from the beans, with smaller particles extracting faster than bigger particles.

        When you brew coffee, you want all of your grounds to be about the same size, so all of the particles brew at the same rate. Being able to control the exact size of your ground coffee gives you a lot more control over the brewing process.
        
        With burr grinders you can do exactly that; they make it incredibly easy for you to repeatedly produce a very specific grind size. One of our favorite grinders for home use is the Handground Precision Grinder; with 15 unique grind settings, this grinder letâ€™s you consistently produce the perfect grind size for your brew.</p>
